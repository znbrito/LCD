# AVR Library for hd44780.h controller
This library was initially developed by SA Development (and that version is also included here). I upgraded this library with more usefull functions
# LCD Keypad Shield
As i bought an Arduino Uno Plus and a LCD Keypad Shield for it, and the LCD had the hd44780 controller, this library was very usefull and
i had to share it. There is also an example program written in Portuguese, since it's my native language. It explains the upgraded library
functions, plus the specific use for the LCD Keypad Shield.

Special thanks to SA Development for making this library so versatile
